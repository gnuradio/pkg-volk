volk (1.0.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Maintenance release 24 Jul 2015 by Nathan West
  * The major change is the CMake logic to add ASM protokernels. Rather
    than depending on CFLAGS and ASMFLAGS we use the results of VOLK's
    built in has_ARCH tests. All configurations should work the same as
    before, but manually specifying CFLAGS and ASMFLAGS on the cmake call
    for ARM native builds should no longer be necessary.
  * The 32fc_s32fc_x2_rotator_32fc generic protokernel now includes a
    previously implied header.
  * Finally, there is a fix to return the "best" protokernel to the
    dispatcher when no volk_config exists. Thanks to Alexandre Raymond for
    pointing this out.
  * with maint branch patch:
      kernels-add-missing-include-arm_neon.h
  * removed unused build-dependency on liboil0.3-dev (closes: #793626)

volk (1.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Maintenance Release v1.0.1 08 Jul 2015 by Nathan West
    This is a maintenance release with bug fixes since the initial release of
    v1.0 in April.
    
  * Contributors
   
    The following authors have contributed code to this release:
    
    Doug Geiger doug.geiger@bioradiation.net
    Elliot Briggs elliot.briggs@gmail.com
    Marcus Mueller marcus@hostalia.de
    Nathan West nathan.west@okstate.edu
    Tom Rondeau tom@trondeau.com
   
  * Kernels
   
    Several bug fixes in different kernels. The NEON implementations of the
    following kernels have been fixed:
   
      32f_x2_add_32f
      32f_x2_dot_prod_32f
      32fc_s32fc_multiply_32fc
      32fc_x2_multiply_32fc
   
   Additionally the NEON asm based 32f_x2_add_32f protokernels were not being
   used and are now included and available for use via the dispatcher.
   
   The 32f_s32f_x2_fm_detect_32f kernel now has a puppet. This solves QA seg
   faults on 32-bit machines and provide a better test for this kernel.
   
   The 32fc_s32fc_x2_rotator_32fc generic protokernel replaced cabsf with
   hypotf for better Android support.

  * Building
   
    Static builds now trigger the applications (volk_profile and
    volk-config-info) to be statically linked.
    
    The file gcc_x86_cpuid.h has been removed since it was no longer being
    used. Previously it provided cpuid functionality for ancient compilers
    that we do not support.
    
    All build types now use -Wall.

  * QA and Testing
   
   The documentation around the --update option to volk_profile now makes it
   clear that the option will only profile kernels without entries in
   volk_profile. The signature of run_volk_tests with expanded args changed
   signed types to unsigned types to reflect the actual input.
   
   The remaining changes are all non-functional changes to address issues
   from Coverity.

volk (1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial package (Closes: #782417)
  Initial Release 11 Apr 2015 by Nathan West
  
  VOLK 1.0 is available. This is the first release of VOLK as an independently
  tracked sub-project of GNU Radio.

  * Contributors
  
  VOLK has been tracked separately from GNU Radio since 2014 Dec 23.
  Contributors between the split and the initial release are

  Albert Holguin aholguin_77@yahoo.com
  Doug Geiger doug.geiger@bioradiation.net
  Elliot Briggs elliot.briggs@gmail.com
  Julien Olivain julien.olivain@lsv.ens-cachan.fr
  Michael Dickens michael.dickens@ettus.com

  * QA
  
  The test and profiler have significantly changed. The profiler supports
  run-time changes to vlen and iters to help kernel development and provide
  more flexibility on embedded systems. Additionally there is a new option
  to update an existing volk_profile results file with only new kernels which
  will save time when updating to newer versions of VOLK
  
  The QA system creates a static list of kernels and test cases. The QA
  testing and profiler iterate over this static list rather than each source
  file keeping its own list. The QA also emits XML results to
  lib/.unittest/kernels.xml which is formatted similarly to JUnit results.
  
  * Modtool
  
  Modtool was updated to support the QA and profiler changes.

  * Kernels
  
  New proto-kernels:
  
  16ic_deinterleave_real_8i_neon
  16ic_s32f_deinterleave_32f_neon
  fix preprocessor errors for some compilers on byteswap and popcount puppets
  
  ORC was moved to the asm kernels directory.
  volk_malloc
  
  The posix_memalign implementation of Volk_malloc now falls back to a standard
  malloc if alignment is 1.
  
  * Miscellaneous
  
  Several build system and cmake changes have made it possible to build VOLK
  both independently with proper soname versions and in-tree for projects
  such as GNU Radio.
  
  The static builds take advantage of cmake object libraries to speed up builds.
  
  Finally, there are a number of changes to satisfy compiler warnings and make
  QA work on multiple machines.
